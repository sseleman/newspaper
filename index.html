<body><h1>Input/Output 04-22 Notes</h1><p></p><p></p><p>Before this we all worked on our programming languages.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>---</p><p></p><p>Discussion about Processing versus openFrameworks. Processing is like having a learners permit as a teenager. openFrameworks is like being an adult with a full lisence. margin for error is greater, but you can go farther. Also, datatypes is weird in Java.</p><p></p><p><a href='/ep/profile/AUZb6pnTdHj'/>Zach Lieberman</a> is pro code on a page, not on a screen. Code is typography. Super important to remember this. The easiest code to understand is no code. The best way to learn is to not look at code, but rather to organize it. Think of it as a hypertext way of writing, not a linear way of writing. you don&rsquo;t have to think about what&rsquo;s in the link. you can drill down to look at what&rsquo;s there in the link, but you don&rsquo;t have to. There is the option of abstraction that is very powerful.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>He sees people get really tripped up with organizing the code. It&rsquo;s easy to get lost in code in terms of context so organization is really important.</p><p></p><p>Horror story time:</p><p>[Zach and Golan Levin] were working together to track people on stage and track their voices [messa di voce <a href="http://www.flong.com/projects/messa/"></a>http://www.flong.com/projects/messa/]. some live performance thing. had a student come to meet them to help with the project. the student flew out, drank red bull non stop, wrote a totally unintelligible codebase. it seemed to work, but didn&rsquo;t actually work when they got to the theater. there was a function called &rsquo;process&rsquo; that was 7 pages long. it was crazy, so much in there, poorly stuctured. it was a nightmare. Zach went to the press office and printed it out to be able to sort out what was going on. Zach could find the bugs when it was on paper.&nbsp;</p><p></p><p>Moral: We get lost on the computer screen. We need new ways of thinking through our code.&nbsp;</p><ul class="comment"><li>Now I understand why we&rsquo;re given all these recommendations of print books to read.</li></ul>

        <h2>Good</h2>

        The title cut from The Dicks’ first single, “Hate the Police,” released in 1980 is one of their most well-known songs, but everything they recorded in their original incarnation from 1980 to 1986 is gold. The Peace? EP, the split live LP with the Big Boys, the Kill From the Heart LP, and the These People LP are all monsters and I’d be torn on trying to recommend any one of those over another. Alternative Tentacles put out a compilation titled Dicks: 1980-1986—that’s a good “greatest hits” type starting place
